# Real-World Scenario: The Toolkit Mandate

Your presentation to the leadership team was a success. Maria, the Director of Operations, was impressed with the clear, no-hype overview of Generative AI's capabilities and limitations. She pulls you aside the next day. **_"That was exactly what we needed,"_** she says. **"You've sold us on the what. Now I need a concrete plan for the how. The executive team is ready to greenlight a pilot program for the internal tools group, but they have questions I can't answer yet."**

She starts ticking points off on her fingers. **_"First, what specific tools and platforms would we actually need to sign up for? I don't want teams using a dozen different free sites with no oversight. Second, what's the budget? I keep hearing these services aren't free for real use; I need to understand how the costs work. Third, our lead architect is concerned about sending proprietary data to third-party services. He's asking if we can run this stuff on our own servers. I need you to come back to me by next week with a practical setup guide. Give me a proposed 'starter kit' for the team, a primer on how we'll be charged for it, and a clear recommendation on the 'cloud vs. local' question. It's time to build the toolkit."_**

You recognize the assignment's true nature. Maria isn't just asking for a list of tools; she's asking you to be the architect of the team's entire AI operational framework. To deliver the practical "setup guide" she requires, you must move beyond a simple list of apps and build a professional, enterprise-ready toolkit that addresses cost, security, and deployment.

Your mission is clear: develop the logistical and strategic understanding needed to confidently answer her three core questions – what tools to use, how to pay for them, and where to run them – and build a toolkit that is powerful, secure, and cost-effective.

## Note

Your manager, Maria, has tasked you with defining a standard "starter kit" for the new AI pilot program. You realize that to address her key concern – a chaotic environment with "a dozen different apps for a dozen different tasks" – you can't just assemble a list of popular products. You need a logical framework for grouping tools by their core business function.

## Define the Professional's AI Toolkit

A professional AI toolkit is not a random collection of applications; **it is a curated set of generative tools chosen to address specific professional workflows**. The goal is to evolve from being a reactive user of whatever is new to become a strategic operator who consciously selects the right tool for the job.

A chef doesn't just have "cooking things." They have specific knives for dicing and filleting, different pans for searing and simmering, and specialized tools such as stand mixers. Each tool serves a unique function.|

Now that the concept of a curated toolkit has been explained, let's explore the essential tool categories.

## Core Tool Categories: LLM Chatbots and Assistants

A Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot or assistant is your primary "thought partner" for all language-based work. While often used interchangeably, it's useful to think of a chatbot as a standalone, conversational tool you interact with in a chat window, and an assistant as a tool that is integrated directly into another application (such as code editor or word processor) to help you with tasks in that context. A power user categorizes these tools not by brand, but by their specific cognitive strengths, to select the right one for a given task.

The diagram below illustrates the three primary strengths of modern LLM chatbots and assistants:

[![An A I brain icon points to three distinct capabilities: language generation, problem solving, and knowledge and fact retrieval.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-LLMChatbots-00.svg "An A I brain icon points to three distinct capabilities: language generation, problem solving, and knowledge and fact retrieval.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-LLMChatbots-00.svg)

Let’s explore a few of the most widely used and innovative options currently available in this category. The list below is structured by key LLM chatbot and assistant strengths, to help you decide on your preferred LLM tool. Remember, the field is evolving rapidly, so it’s important to re-evaluate your toolkit regularly as new tools and features appear.

MEMORANDUM
|**TO:** Maria, Director of Operations|
|**SUBJECT:** Proposal for a Foundational "AI Starter Kit" for the Pilot Program|
||

|   |
|---|
|**1.0 Introduction**|
|Per your request, this memorandum outlines a proposed "AI Starter Kit." This is a curated set of tools, each selected for a specific cognitive function to support our team's needs in project management, system administration, and content creation, while providing the necessary oversight and security.|
|**2.0 Proposed Toolkit Categories**|
|I recommend a foundational toolkit built on three primary and one supporting category of tools.|
|**2.1 Primary Tool Category: General-Purpose LLM Assistants**|
|This will be the team's core "thought partner" for all language-based work. A single, powerful LLM can handle a wide range of tasks. We will evaluate and select a primary platform based on these essential capabilities:<br><br>- **Expressive and Creative Language Generation:** For drafting project updates, creating documentation, and overcoming the "blank page problem."<br>    <br>    1. **Selected Tool Example: ChatGPT, Claude 3.**<br>        <br>- **Technical and Logical Problem Solving:** For analyzing cryptic error logs, producing a list of probable causes, or generating a Python script to automate a configuration backup.<br>    <br>    1. **Selected Tool Example: Gemini Advanced, DeepSeek Coder.**<br>        <br>- **Up-to-Date Knowledge and Fact Retrieval:** To address your concerns about accuracy, any task requiring current, verifiable information will be routed to a model with live search and citation capabilities.<br>    <br>    1. **Selected Tool Example: YouChat, ChatGPT with browsing enabled.**|
|**2.2 Augmenting Tool Category: Image and Multimedia Generators**|
|To support our content creation and training needs, the toolkit should include access to on-demand multimedia generation.<br><br>- **Creative Visual Generation:** A technical lead can use this to generate a conceptual diagram of a proposed cloud architecture for a slide deck, creating a more engaging visual than a simple Visio drawing.<br>    <br>    1. **Selected Tool Example: Midjourney, DALL-E 3.**<br>        <br>- **Voice and Audio Generation:** This is invaluable for creating scalable training content. Instead of re-recording audio for every minor update to a training module, the script can simply be updated and regenerated.<br>    <br>    1. **Selected Tool Example: ElevenLabs, Murf.**<br>        <br>- **Video Generation:** This emerging capability allows for the rapid creation of video elements for training or internal communications. While still maturing, it is a key area to monitor for future productivity gains.<br>    <br>    1. **Selected Tool Example: Sora, Synthesia.**|
|**2.3 Specialized Tool Category: Integrated AI Code Assistants**|
|To maximize productivity for our technical staff, we must provide a tool that integrates directly into their existing workflow.<br><br>- **Capability:** These tools act as a real-time "pair programmer" inside a code editor (like VS Code), providing intelligent code completion and automating the creation of repetitive boilerplate code for everything from Python to Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates.<br>    <br>- **Justification:** This directly addresses the need for a low-friction "quick win" for our developers and system administrators.<br>    <br>    1. **Selected Tool Example: GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q Developer.**<br>        <br>- **Note on Conversational Code Architecture:** For higher-level tasks like designing an algorithm or refactoring complex functions, the team will be trained to use our primary LLM Assistant (for example, Claude 3), which excels at this type of dialogue-based problem-solving.|

# Build Your AI Toolkit

Your manager, Maria, has tasked you with defining a standard "starter kit" for the new AI pilot program. You realize that to address her key concern – a chaotic environment with "a dozen different apps for a dozen different tasks" – you can't just assemble a list of popular products. You need a logical framework for grouping tools by their core business function.

## Define the Professional's AI Toolkit

A professional AI toolkit is not a random collection of applications; **it is a curated set of generative tools chosen to address specific professional workflows**. The goal is to evolve from being a reactive user of whatever is new to become a strategic operator who consciously selects the right tool for the job.

A chef doesn't just have "cooking things." They have specific knives for dicing and filleting, different pans for searing and simmering, and specialized tools such as stand mixers. Each tool serves a unique function.|

Now that the concept of a curated toolkit has been explained, let's explore the essential tool categories.

## Core Tool Categories: LLM Chatbots and Assistants

A Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot or assistant is your primary "thought partner" for all language-based work. While often used interchangeably, it's useful to think of a chatbot as a standalone, conversational tool you interact with in a chat window, and an assistant as a tool that is integrated directly into another application (such as code editor or word processor) to help you with tasks in that context. A power user categorizes these tools not by brand, but by their specific cognitive strengths, to select the right one for a given task.

The diagram below illustrates the three primary strengths of modern LLM chatbots and assistants:

[![An A I brain icon points to three distinct capabilities: language generation, problem solving, and knowledge and fact retrieval.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-LLMChatbots-00.svg "An A I brain icon points to three distinct capabilities: language generation, problem solving, and knowledge and fact retrieval.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-LLMChatbots-00.svg)

# Essential Platforms and Accounts

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[![Real world scenario icon.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.svg "Real world scenario icon.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.svg)|You have selected the types of tools to be included in your pilot program. Now, you must address your Director's critical concern about teams using unmanaged, free sites with no oversight. The solution is to gain professional, managed access to enterprise-grade AI services.|

This topic explores the origins of AI models and the mechanics of professional access, focusing on the platforms, accounts, and API keys that are non-negotiable for a business pilot.

## AI Supply Chain: From Model Hubs to Cloud Platforms

Before you can evaluate commercial tools and make a smart decision, you first need to understand the AI "supply chain." Click each tab below to learn about the two key stages: the source models and the cloud services that deliver them.

- The Source - Model Hubs
- The Service - Cloud AI Platforms

- **What they are:** Model hubs like **Hugging Face** are public repositories where developers and researchers share thousands of raw, pre-trained AI models.
    
- **Your Role (Due Diligence):** For a business leader, these hubs are not for downloading models, but for conducting crucial due diligence.
    
    1. A key task is **The "Proprietary" Model Check**: Is that new AI startup's amazing model just a repackaged open-source model from a hub? A quick search can reveal the source and, most importantly, its **license**, to ensure it's approved for commercial use and protect your company from legal risk.
        

## Professional Account: Your Gateway to Enterprise AI

This long string of characters is the password your application will use to authenticate to the service.|

## Security Non-Negotiables for Enterprise Accounts

A tool is not "business-ready" without robust administrative controls. Consumer-grade accounts are unacceptable for team-wide use. Look for these essential enterprise features:

- **Centralized User Management:** You must be able to add users and, more importantly, instantly remove them from a central dashboard. This prevents former employees from retaining access.
    
- **Usage Monitoring:** A good admin console allows you to monitor who is using the service and how much. This is critical for both cost management and security auditing.
    
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with your company's identity system (such as Okta, Azure AD) is the gold standard for security and convenience.
    
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If SSO is not an option, MFA must be enforced for all users without exception.
    
- **Zero Data Retention (ZDR):** This critical contractual promise ensures that your prompts and outputs will not be stored on the provider's servers or used to train their models.
    

## Conclusion

Securing the proper accounts on enterprise-grade platforms is the foundational step for a professional AI pilot. This approach provides the API access necessary for automation while granting leadership the management and security oversight they require. By understanding the AI supply chain and prioritizing platforms that offer these essential enterprise features, you are ready to move on to the next step: a detailed evaluation of the tools themselves.

# Evaluate AI Platforms and Services

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[![Real world scenario icon.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.svg "Real world scenario icon.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.svg)|You've established a plan for obtaining professional, secure access to enterprise-grade AI platforms. Now, you face your first critical stakeholder test: your Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is asking tough, pointed questions about your proposed tools.|
|This is the moment that distinguishes a casual user from an AI architect. To address the CISO's questions and make a defensible decision, you need a formal evaluation framework.|

This topic provides the formal evaluation framework you need, equipping you to perform a professional-grade assessment of any AI tool.

## Enterprise Evaluation Framework

To evaluate platforms efficiently, a professional uses a two-step process. You start with a quick, 5-minute external check to eliminate immature platforms. Only the tools that pass this initial filter then proceed to a deeper, formal evaluation using a scorecard.

|   |   |
|---|---|
Step 1: The 5-Minute Enterprise Vetting
|Before conducting a formal evaluation of any new AI tool, perform this quick check on their website:|   |
|✓|**Find the "Enterprise," "Business," or "Trust" page.** The absence of a dedicated enterprise security page is a deal-breaker.|
|✓|**Look for SOC 2 Compliance.** This should be clearly and proudly stated.|
|✓|**Confirm SSO support.** If it's not explicitly offered for business tiers, the tool is not enterprise-ready.|
|✓|**Verify their Data Retention Policy.** Look for clear language promising Zero Data Retention for business customers. If you have to dig for it, be skeptical.|

|   |
|---|
Step 2: The Formal Evaluation Scorecard
|If a platform passes the 5-minute vetting, you can proceed to a more formal evaluation using a scorecard built on four pillars of evaluation.|

A power user, acting as a professional architect, evaluates tools like a senior business leader, balancing potential with risk.

Click each tab to learn about a pillar of evaluation and its key criteria.

- Performance
- Compliance
- Admin Controls
- Security

Does it excel at your specific tasks?

**Performance**
The first pillar of evaluation is performance against a real-world business scenario. A model that is great at creative writing may fail at analyzing technical logs. Generic benchmarks are a starting point, but they are no substitute for testing against your actual needs.

- **For a Network Engineering team:** Can the model accurately interpret a BGP configuration file and identify potential route-leak vulnerabilities?
    
- **For a Project Management team:** How well does the model summarize a long, jargon-filled project status meeting transcript into clear, actionable bullet points?
**Strategic Foresight:** Never commit to a platform without running a pilot with real-world, non-sensitive data. You must measure both the quantitative improvement (for example, time saved per task) and the qualitative output. If the quality of the AI's output requires more time to fix than the original task took, the tool has a negative ROI.

**Compliance**
Is this tool legally and professionally safe?

[![Four pillars of A I platform evaluation, represented with four icons with the first two pillars clearly visible. The Performance and Compliance icons are shown, while the rest are blurred out.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-Evaluate-01.svg "Four pillars of A I platform evaluation, represented with four icons with the first two pillars clearly visible. The Performance and Compliance icons are shown, while the rest are blurred out.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-Evaluate-01.svg)

Using a tool that isn't compliant with industry standards can expose your company to significant legal and financial risk.

- **Key Certifications:** Check for standard enterprise certifications like SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, and, for healthcare-related data, HIPAA compliance. The absence of these is a major red flag that the provider is not mature enough for business use.
    
- **Copyright Indemnification:** For tools that generate images or code, ask if they offer copyright indemnification. This is a form of legal protection where the provider agrees to cover legal costs if you are sued for copyright infringement for using the content their AI generated.
-

**Administration**
Will IT or power users have oversight?

[![Four pillars of A I platform evaluation, represented with the first three pillars clearly visible. The Performance, Compliance, and Administration icons are shown, while the final icon is blurred out.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-Evaluate-02.svg "Four pillars of A I platform evaluation, represented with the first three pillars clearly visible.

A tool without centralized administration is an unmanageable security risk. Consumer-grade accounts are unacceptable for team deployment.

- **User Management:** The platform must provide a central dashboard to provision and de-provision user access instantly.
    
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with your company's identity provider (for example, Okta, Azure AD) is a non-negotiable security feature. It enforces your company's authentication policies and simplifies user management.
    
    1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If SSO is not an option, MFA must be enforced for all users without exception.
        
- **Audit Logs:** The platform must provide detailed logs of user activity (for example, who logged in, when, what queries were run). This is essential for both security incident response and cost management.

**Security**
Will this platform protect our data?

[![All four pillars of A I platform evaluation represented byt the icons for Performance, Compliance, Administration, and Security, all clearly visible.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-Evaluate-03.svg "All four pillars of A I platform evaluation represented byt the icons for Performance, Compliance, Administration, and Security, all clearly visible.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Artificial%20Intelligence/Modular/AITECH/v1.0/AITECH_C12/AITECH-10-12-Evaluate-03.svg)

For any enterprise, this is the most critical question. A power user must think like a security professional and demand specific, contractual promises.

- **Zero Data Retention (ZDR):** This is the gold standard for enterprise accounts. It is a contractual guarantee that your inputs (prompts) and outputs (generations) will not be stored by the provider or used to train their future models.
    
- **Data Encryption:** Demand specifics. Data must be encrypted both in transit (using TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest (using AES-256 or a similar strong standard).

## Cloud vs Local LLMs
When you're implementing an LLM into your workflow, one of the first critical decisions is the deployment. Your choice is between using a cloud API or running a local model. Each path offers distinct advantages and strategic trade-offs.

Using a cloud AI API is like plugging into the public power grid. You get immediate access to immense computational power without having to build or maintain the power plant yourself. This is a pay-as-you-go model.

The primary benefits are scale and simplicity. You gain access to powerful models. You pay only for what you use or what you've subscribed to. And you avoid the need to manage complex infrastructure. The trade-offs are compromised data privacy and potential high costs. You can also experience network issues and have minimal control over the models you use.

Deploying a model locally is like installing your own private generator. You are responsible for the entire system, from the initial hardware investment to ongoing operational requirements and data management. The key advantages here are control and privacy. All data processing happens within your environment, offering maximum security.

The system can operate offline, and there are no per-use costs after the initial setup. The trade-offs are a higher upfront cost and a more complex deployment. You also lose access to other models, and your scalability is limited.

The choice is not about which architecture is better. It is about which one is right for your project specific needs. Do you require the unlimited power of the public grid or the control and privacy of a private generator? Understanding this trade-off is the first step in making the right architectural decision.

# Local LLM Deployment Concepts

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[![Real world scenario icon.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.svg "Real world scenario icon.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.svg)|Your project plan must directly address the lead architect's concern regarding the transmission of proprietary data to third parties. The "private generator" analogy has opened the door, but now you need to provide the technical substance to back it up. To make a credible recommendation, you must explain what local deployment actually entails, including its benefits, requirements, and limitations.|

This topic provides the technical details for that recommendation.

## Local LLM Deployment versus Cloud APIs

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Local LLM Deployment** is a self-hosted model. You download an open-source AI model and run it on hardware that your company controls, whether it's a developer's high-end workstation or a server in your own data center. In this model, your team is the operator of the AI. Your application makes a call to a local service endpoint (for example, localhost:11434) that does not traverse the public internet.|**Cloud API Deployment** is a service-based model in which you send data across the internet to an AI model hosted and managed by an external company. Your team operates as a consumer of the service, benefiting from the provider's massive scale and expertise without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Your application makes an HTTPS request to an endpoint, authenticates with an API key, and receives a response.|

Now that we have examined the distinctions between local LLM deployment and cloud API deployment, let's explore why a team would undertake the significant effort of a local deployment.

## Advantages of Local Deployment

The primary motivation for choosing local deployment over a Major Cloud Provider (MCP) is to achieve complete control over the environment, which directly addresses the architect's security concerns. While cloud APIs offer convenience and scale, a local model provides various key advantages. The figure below illustrates the four primary benefits of this approach.

- offline capable: Applications built on local models can run without an internet connection, a critical feature for on-premise tools or environments with restricted network access.
- control and cost: Your team has full control over the model version, its configuration, and when to apply updates. This avoids any unexpected changes from a cloud provider that could affect your workflows.
- cost prediction: After the initial hardware investment, there are no per-transaction costs. For high-volume, repetitive tasks, this can be more cost-effective than a pay-as-you-go API model.
- privacy and security: This is the paramount advantage. With a local model, sensitive data (like proprietary source code, customer information, or strategic documents) is processed entirely within your network's perimeter. It is never transmitted to a third party.

## Overview of Tools for Local Deployment

Achieving the advantages of privacy and control with local deployment was once the domain of specialists. However, the open-source ecosystem has produced excellent tools that now simplify this process.

It is critical to understand that local LLM deployment isn't one-size-fits-all. The tool an individual developer uses for private testing is very different from the complex servers a large enterprise would deploy. The ecosystem has evolved into four distinct tiers, where each tier trades ease-of-use for more power, scale, and operational control.

Tier 1: Single-User Tools for Development

**Single-User Tools for Development** tier is for individual developers and analysts running LLMs on their own machines for prompt engineering, testing, and private exploration. The goal is maximum simplicity and a setup time of minutes.

- **Tools:** Ollama is a popular command-line tool for this, while LM Studio and GPT4All provide a graphical user interface (GUI).
    
    ## Note
    
    **Choose this tier if:** You are an individual testing locally, have no infrastructure budget, or need a low-friction tool for non-technical team members.
Tier 2: Production-Grade Servers for Multi-User Teams

**Production-Grade Servers for Multi-User Teams** tier is for small to medium teams (5-50 users) who need to share a local model. It focuses on performance and reliability, allowing multiple users to query the AI simultaneously. The operational burden is moderate, and it becomes a cost-effective option when cloud API spending is significant.

- **How it works:** This involves running a production-grade inference server, like vLLM, on a dedicated machine with one or more powerful GPUs.
    
    ## Note
    
    **Choose this tier if:** You have 5-50 concurrent users, significant monthly cloud API spend, or strict data sensitivity requirements.
Tier 3: Enterprise Production Deployment

Enterprise Production Deployment tier is for large organizations where local inference is a core, mission-critical platform capability serving hundreds of users. It focuses on maximum uptime, redundancy, and auto-scaling, often using multi-node GPU clusters managed by an orchestration platform. The operational burden is substantial and requires a dedicated DevOps/SRE team.

- **How it works:** This typically involves running optimized inference frameworks on Kubernetes to provide redundancy and auto-scaling across a cluster of powerful machines.
    
    ## Note
    
    **Choose this tier if:** You have company-wide adoption (100+ users), local inference is a strategic advantage, and uptime is critical.
Tier 4: Hybrid Deployment (Local + Cloud Fallback)

Hybrid Deployment tier offers the best of both worlds for teams with unpredictable workloads. A local server handles the normal, baseline query load cheaply and efficiently. When demand suddenly spikes, a proxy layer automatically routes the overflow traffic to a cloud API. This optimizes cost while guaranteeing reliability.

- **How it works:** A proxy tool like LiteLLM is used to intelligently route requests to either the local server or a cloud API based on the current load.
    
- **Choose this tier if:** Your query load is highly variable, cost optimization is a primary driver, and using a cloud API as a fallback is acceptable.

Does your organization have a dedicated DevOps/SRE team and an infrastructure budget for this?

## Basic Hardware and Software Requirements

The primary trade-off for the privacy and control of local deployment is the requirement for powerful, specialized hardware.

LLMs are computationally demanding. The figure below illustrates the three critical hardware components required for a local deployment. It's important to understand not just the component, but the key metric for evaluating it:

- For system memory, the key metric is RAM capacity.
    
- For the graphics card, the key metric is its dedicated VRAM capacity.
    
- For the hard drive, the key metric is its speed, represented here by NVMe SSD technology.
A significant amount of system RAM is required to load the model's weights. 16 GB is a bare minimum for small models, with 32 GB or 64 GB being necessary for larger, more capable models.
While it's possible to run some models on a CPU, performance is drastically better on a modern GPU. The most important metric is the GPU's dedicated Video RAM (VRAM). Many useful models require at least 8-12 GB of VRAM, with more advanced models requiring 16-24 GB or more.
The models themselves are large files (4GB to 70GB+), so a fast SSD is required to store them and quickly load them.

## Challenges and Limitations of Local Setups

## Conclusion

Local LLM deployment is a powerful strategy that offers maximum data privacy and control, directly addressing the concerns of security-conscious stakeholders. Tools like Ollama have made this more accessible, but this method requires substantial hardware resources and ongoing operational management. Your recommendation to Maria should present this not as a replacement for cloud APIs, but as a specific solution for use cases involving highly sensitive data where the trade-offs are justified.

Now that you've built your toolkit and vetted your platforms for security, you're ready to build your AI engine. However, you must now face the final critical stakeholder-- finance. They have one key question-- How do we budget for this? Making the right financial decision is just as important as choosing the right technology. Today, we'll decode the two primary pricing models for AI services to ensure you understand the financial impact of your AI model choice.

First, let's explore the subscription model. Think of it as the all-you-can-eat buffet of the AI services. It's the simplest and most predictable model, where you pay a flat fee per user each month. While some AI subscriptions offer unlimited access, many are structured with clear tiers and usage-based limits. The primary advantage of the subscription model is predictability. Your cost is the same, whether an employee uses the service 10 times or 1,000 times. This simplifies your budget forecasting.

For a finance department, a fixed recurring operational expense is easy to understand and approve. This model is perfect for teams with consistent high-volume usage, such as sales teams of 50 or more representatives who need daily access to an AI assistant to draft outreach emails and various collateral. However, the subscription model has a key risk-- inefficiency. You will pay the same for the high-use sales representative and the low-use human resources manager. For teams with sporadic needs, you could be paying for capacity that goes unused.

Alternatively, there is the usage-based or token model. This is the utility model of AI. Instead of paying a flat fee for access, you only pay for what you consume. In the AI context, consumption is measured in tokens, the fragments of words that models process. However, a critical detail to take into account is that with this model, you are billed for the entire transaction. That means you pay for the tokens in both your prompt and for the tokens in the AI's response.

A long, complex question that returns a long, detailed answer will be doubly expensive. This is the fundamental concept for managing usage-based costs. The primary advantages of the usage-based model are efficiency and scalability. A short, simple task costs only pennies, while a massive, complex task costs more. There is no wasted expense on idle users, making it the default choice for developers integrating AI into an application, where usage might start small and grow over time. It's also ideal for a research and development team with massive but infrequent data analysis projects.

However, the usage-based model also carries a risk-- volatility. A bug in a script, an unexpected spike in customer usage, or an inefficiently designed workflow can lead to a surprisingly high bill. This model requires careful monitoring, with budget alerts and spending caps in place, to prevent cost overruns. Beyond the sticker price, power users can generate significant hidden operational costs. With token-based models, every failed prompt that requires a retry cost you money.

Using a premium, expensive AI model for a simple summarization task is like taking a taxi across the street-- it's a waste of resources. True cost management isn't just about the pricing model. It's about using that model efficiently. So how do you choose? You must align the financial model with your strategic mission. If your mission is to boost the daily productivity of a specific team, and you expect their usage to be fairly consistent, the predictability of the subscription model is your safest and best choice.

However, if your mission is to integrate AI into a team developing an application or into a team of data analysts with spiky, unpredictable usage, the efficiency of the usage-based token model is the smarter financial path. A larger organization does not need to choose between usage-based or subscription-based models. In reality, a hybrid approach of both models allows you to get the best of both worlds.

In this scenario, you equip your high-volume, predictable teams, such as sales and marketing, with stable, easy-to-budget subscriptions. This caps your costs and simplifies forecasting. Meanwhile, you provide your developers and R&D teams, whose needs are more volatile, with a flexible, monitored, usage-based budget. This strategy allows you to maximize productivity for your people while maintaining cost efficiency for your processes.

And that was a review of the two dominant pricing models for AI. Choosing a pricing model is more than a line item on a budget-- it's a strategic decision that shapes how your organization can innovate. By understanding the trade offs and aligning your financial model with your strategic use case, you can build an AI engine that is not only powerful and secure, but also fiscally responsible. Thanks for watching.

# Build Your AI Evaluation Scorecard

## Scenario

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[![Real world scenario icon.](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.png "Real world scenario icon.")](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/BrandingAssets/CustomNoteIcons/RealWorldScenario-Icon.png)|Your presentation to Maria was a success, but now she requires a concrete plan. Her lead architect is concerned about security, and she needs to see a defensible process for selecting tools. Your first step in fulfilling her mandate is to tackle a real, high-value business problem. To address the customer support team's overload, you've decided to pilot an AI tool that can accurately summarize long, technical customer support tickets into a 3-bullet-point summary for your senior engineers.|

This lab is your first act as the team's "strategic filter." Your mission is to perform a professional due diligence exercise on two potential open-source models for this specific task. You will build a defensible "AI Evaluation Scorecard" and use it to make a data-driven recommendation, proving to Maria that you have developed a rigorous process for evaluating AI technology.

Your two key evaluation criteria are:

1. Accuracy in summarizing technical details
    
2. Obtaining a commercial-use-friendly license
    

## Note

The responses you receive from your Generative AI tools may differ from the sample outputs provided in this discovery.

You may need to create an account and log in to your selected LLM chatbot platform in order to complete this lab exercise.

## Navigate and Search Models

You will identify two potential open-source models from Hugging Face. This analysis will demonstrate why the AI landscape requires systematic evaluation rather than making arbitrary selections.

### Step 1

Show Me

Open the **Chrome** web browser and navigate to [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models) and explore the interface.

### Step 2

Show Me

Use the search filters on the left sidebar. Choose **Tasks > Summarization** to filter relevant models.

Notice the search results. You should see hundreds of summarization models.

This demonstrates why systematic evaluation is crucial - you should never arbitrarily choose a model.

### Step 3

Show Me

For this lab, we'll evaluate these two pre-selected candidates that are well-documented and widely-used. Click on each model name to open their model cards in new tabs:

- **Candidate A:** facebook/bart-large-cnn
    
- **Candidate B:** Falconsai/text_summarizationz
    

### Step 4

**Optional Step**: Browse a few other summarization models in the results. Notice the differences between their descriptions, training data, and performance claims. This reinforces why systematic evaluation is essential.

## Complete the Evaluation Scorecard

Now, you will analyze the model cards for each candidate and fill out a scorecard. For each model, find the key information and rate it based on your business scenario.

![Note icon](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Learning%20at%20Cisco/Premium%20Certification%20Content/Networking/AISKILL/v1.0/Graphics/Generic/Tips-Icon.svg)

## Note

A model card tells a story. The most effective ones clearly communicate the model’s strengths and limitations with transparency.

Be skeptical of any model card that claims the model has no limitations.

### Step 5

Show Me

Analyze the **facebook/bart-large-cnn** model card. Scroll through the entire page and take note of the key sections.

### Step 6

Show Me

In the upper right corner of the **BART** model page, locate the **License** section. You should see that it mentions the mit license.

### Step 7

Show Me

Next, on the right, locate the **Dataset used to train** section. Note that BART was trained on the **ccn_dailymail** dataset (news articles).

### Step 8

Show Me

Now on the left, check the **Intended uses & limitations** and document any specific warnings or known issues.

### Step 9

Show Me

Let's note the popularity metrics: **Likes, Downloads last month, and Spaces using** _model name_. **Likes** are In the upper left corner, while **Downloads last month** and **Spaces using** _model name_ are on the right.

### Step 10

Show Me

Repeat the first five steps of the **Complete Evaluation Scorecard** task for the **Falconsai/text_summarization** model card.

### Step 11

Show Me

Create a table like the one shown here and populate it with the information you gathered.

### Step 12

Click on the **Files and versions** tab for each model to view the actual model files and sizes. This gives you a sense of the computational requirements for deployment.

## Make Your Recommendations

Based on your completed scorecard, answer the following questions as if you were presenting your recommendation to your manager. This is where evaluation transitions into business decision-making.

![Note icon](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Learning%20at%20Cisco/Premium%20Certification%20Content/Networking/AISKILL/v1.0/Graphics/Generic/Tips-Icon.svg)

## Note

Frame your recommendation around business impact, not technical specifications. Your manager cares about risk, cost, and outcomes.

### Step 13

Based on your completed scorecard, analyze which model is better suited for technical support ticket summarization.

Consider these factors:

- Does the training data (news vs. technical text) align with your use case?
    
- Is the license suitable for commercial deployment?
    
- Are there specific limitations that would affect accuracy on technical content?
    

### Step 14

Document your recommendation as if you plan to present it to your manager:

- **Primary Recommendation:** [Choose A or B]
    
- **Justification:** [Use at least two specific data points from your scorecard]
    
- **Biggest Risk:** [Identify the main concern with your chosen model. (for example, "The model's restrictive license is a potential legal risk.")]
    
- **Next Step:** What would you do before full deployment? (for example, "Propose a small-scale, 30-day pilot with the support team to validate the performance on our real-world data before committing to a wider rollout.")]
    
- **Critical Thinking:**
    
    1. If both models have significant limitations for technical text, what would be your recommendation to leadership about proceeding with this AI initiative?
        

### Step 15

**Optional Step:** Research whether either Facebook or Google offers enterprise-grade APIs for these models. Finding such an API would change your deployment and support considerations significantly.

## Quick Enterprise Vetting

Now you'll practice the "5-Minute Enterprise Vetting" technique. This exercise highlights the distinctions between evaluating open-source models and assessing commercial AI services for business deployment. You will understand why enterprise readiness goes far beyond model performance.

![Note icon](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Learning%20at%20Cisco/Premium%20Certification%20Content/Networking/AISKILL/v1.0/Graphics/Generic/Tips-Icon.svg)

## Note

Most businesses will not deploy raw, open-source models on their own. Instead, they will access them through enterprise-grade commercial services. This task shows you what enterprise-grade AI truly entails.

### Step 16

Show Me

Go to [https://trust.openai.com/](https://trust.openai.com/) and look for their enterprise/security information.

### Step 17

Show Me

Let's start vetting! To do that, we'll check our key security features:

1. **SOC 2** compliance located under **Documents > All > COMPLIANCE**
    
2. **Data Retention** policy located under **Data Security**
    
3. **SSO availability** located under **Access Control > Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**
    
4. **HR Security** located under **Corporate Security**
    

### Step 18

Optional Step: Visit one more enterprise AI platform (for example, [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com/) or [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/offerings)). Compare their enterprise offerings. Notice the common themes as to what they emphasize to attract business customers.

## Reflection Activity: Professional Application

Take a moment to synthesize your experience. Answer the following questions for yourself.

![Note icon](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/ai-tech-aiarchitectstoolkit-10/assets/Learning%20at%20Cisco/Premium%20Certification%20Content/Networking/AISKILL/v1.0/Graphics/Generic/OpenendedQ-Icon.svg)

## Note

If you were implementing your chosen model for your support team, estimate:

- Time saved per ticket (assume manual summary = 10 minutes, AI summary = 2 minutes)
    
- Cost of implementation (model hosting, integration development)
    
- Risk mitigation needed (human review process, accuracy validation)
    

## Conclusion

By completing this lab, you have performed a structured, professional evaluation of two AI models for a specific business need. You moved beyond casual browsing to create a defensible "Evaluation Scorecard," encouraging you to consider critical factors like licensing and limitations. Executing this process is a core skill of an AI architect, enabling you to make smart, data-driven decisions when building your AI toolkit.

# Content Review Question

You are evaluating a model for a commercial project. Its license is explicitly listed as "for research only." What is the correct business decision?

- Use it, since it's only for an internal project.
    
- Use it, but don't tell the legal team.
    
- Disqualify the model due to license incompatibility.
    
- Use it, because the technology is too good to pass up.
