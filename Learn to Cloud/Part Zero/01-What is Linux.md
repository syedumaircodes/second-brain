# What is Linux

Imagine a computer program is a recipe for baking a cake. Companies like Microsoft or Apple keep their cake recipes locked in a secret vault. You can buy the cake, but you can’t see the recipe, and you definitely aren't allowed to change it. Linux is different. Its recipe is posted publicly on the internet. Anyone can bake the cake, read the recipe, add new ingredients, and share their improved recipe with friends. This is what `Open Source` means.

Linux is an operating system. The main software that makes your computer's hardware work. Linus Torvalds built the Linux kernel, the core part of Linux in 1991. While other necessary tools were built by  Richard Stallman and his team.

Instead of being built by employees at one company, Linux is built by a massive global team of volunteers. Thousands of programmers all over the world talk on the internet, fix bugs, and add features. They use a special legal rule called the `GPL License`. This license allows anyone to edit and upgrade Linux but must share those upgrades for free with everyone.

## Free Software and Open Source

The people who support this shared code are split into two camps:

- The free software philosophers led Stallman, they believe sharing software is a moral issue and locking up technology is unethical.
- The open source contributors realized the word free scared businesses away. They changed the name to open source. Companies like Red Hat make billions not by selling the software, but by charging for customer support.
## Linux Distributions

Because anyone can take the Linux code and tweak it, there are hundreds of different versions, called Distros:

- Fedora and Ubuntu are the most popular and most used Linux distributions due to their ease of use and solid community support.
- Red Hat and Debian are the base stable version of Fedora and Ubuntu respectively used in servers.
- Arch Linux is a DIY version for hardcore computer nerds who want to build their system from scratch.
* Linux Mint and Zorin are based on Ubuntu and are designed specifically to look and feel exactly like Windows beginners don't get confused.
