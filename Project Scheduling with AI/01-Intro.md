  
Think about what happened with DC's Justice League. Warner Bros. had one of the most valuable franchises in the world. The stakes couldn't have been higher, but instead of adjusting the schedule when production delays and director changes hit, executives forced the movie to meet a fixed milestone, the release date tied to their bonuses.

The result? A rushed, half-finished film that critics tore apart, audiences rejected, and the studio lost over $60 million on. One broken schedule, one forced milestone, and an entire brand took years to recover. That's the reality of projects without strong, flexible scheduling.

Timelines aren't just lists of tasks, and milestones aren't just dates. Together they form the backbone of project scheduling. Without them, even billion-dollar projects collapse. But here's the good news. AI changes the game.

With tools like ChatGPT, you don't need to spend weeks building and rebuilding project schedules. You can create a full schedule in minutes, adapting it instantly when things shift, and lock in milestones that actually work. AI doesn't replace project management. It makes you faster, sharper, and far more resilient when things go wrong.

This course will show you exactly how to combine the timeless discipline of project scheduling with the modern power of AI, so you can stay in control no matter what twists your project throws at you. My name is Rahul Iyer. I have spent over 23 years working in Lean Six Sigma, project management, and data analytics, and I have trained professionals across 18-plus industries. Over half a million learners worldwide have taken my courses to strengthen their careers. I will be guiding you step-by-step, making sure the concepts stay practical, clear, and directly useful in your work.

So, what will you learn? By the end of this course, you will be able to build complete project schedules with timelines, tasks, durations, dependencies, and milestones, the backbone of project success. Use AI-powered prompting strategies to create and refine schedules step-by-step. Guide ChatGPT to respect dependencies, task order, and real-world constraints so your schedules actually work. Adapt schedules instantly when deadlines shift, priorities change, or resources get pulled away. Format and visualize AI-generated schedules into spreadsheets, slides, gang charts, or documentation for stakeholder use. Avoid the common pitfalls of AI scheduling that lead to vague, unrealistic, or broken project plans. You won't just learn to plan timelines and milestones. You will master the broader discipline of AI-powered project scheduling, turning hours of manual work into minutes of smart, flexible planning.

To enroll in this course, you don't need to be the project manager of a DC or Marvel blockbuster. You just need to be someone who wants clarity, control, and smarter ways to schedule and manage projects. This course is designed for anyone who has ever struggled to keep a project on track.

You will benefit most if you are a project manager, coordinator, or team lead who needs to organize work with clear, AI-powered schedules. A process analyst or business analyst who wants structured, AI-assisted ways to map and schedule workflows.

A Six Sigma or continuous improvement professional who needs timelines, milestones, and dependencies for structured problem solving. An operations, HR, marketing, or training professional managing projects and scheduling deliverables. A beginner in AI who wants to apply ChatGPT to real, practical scheduling and planning tasks.

A student or early career professional building strong foundations in project scheduling and project management. A freelancer or consultant who wants to bring structure and scheduling discipline to unpredictable work.

If you have ever thought, how do I even start building a project schedule that won't collapse midway? This course is for you. At the end of this journey, you will also be eligible to earn the AIGPE AI Powered Project Schedule Specialist Certification. This credential is globally recognized and is proof that you can plan, structure, and manage projects in a modern, AI-powered way. It's something you can proudly showcase on your resume, LinkedIn profile, and in your professional portfolio. In addition, this course is enabled to earn professional development units, professional development credits, continuing professional development, and continuing education units.

These credits are essential for many professionals who must maintain their project management, HR, quality, and continuing education credentials. This course is designed to move from basics to advanced strategies. Section 1 is scheduling foundations, timelines, and milestones.

Section 2, your first interaction with AI. Section 3, adding context to your prompt. Section 4, progressive prompting, build in layers. Section 5, handling dependencies and sequencing with AI. Section 6, adjusting AI timelines midway.

Section 7, formatting your AI output for real use. Section 8, identifying milestones using AI. Section 9, documenting timelines and milestones in project artifacts. Section 10, creating Gantt charts using AI. Section 11, pitfalls and best practices for AI-powered timelines.

Each section includes short video lessons, quizzes, downloadable prompt libraries, and real-world examples so you can practice as you learn. If you need help at any time, my team is always available at programs at the rate AIGProExcellence.com. Now, who should not enroll in this course?

If you are already an advanced user of AI for project scheduling, someone who regularly uses ChatGPT or similar tools to build, refine, and manage schedules with timelines, milestones, dependencies, and adjustments, this course may feel too basic. But if you are new to applying AI in your scheduling and planning process, or you have only scratched the surface and want a structured, step-by-step approach, this course is the right fit.

You have taken the first step towards mastering one of the most practical skills in project management, which is project scheduling. At its core, scheduling brings together timelines, milestones, dependencies, and adjustments, giving you structure that adapts as your projects evolve.


This course will give you clarity where there is uncertainty, structure where there is chaos, and momentum where projects usually stall. With AI as your partner, you will be ready to schedule smarter, adapt quicker, and deliver with confidence. So let's begin. I will see you in the first lecture.

Hi and welcome to the AIGPE family. If you are here, you have already taken an important step, not just toward completing a course, but toward building skills that actually matter in today's world. This course is not designed as a one-time learning experience. It is designed to be a part of a much larger ecosystem.

00:00:23

And in this lecture, I will discuss with you how can you maximize this ecosystem. We will discuss multiple things that you can access immediately and for free. And I plan to keep them free for some time. So please do take the benefit of this while it is available now for free.

00:00:42

So let's begin. First, let's talk about today's buzzword, Artificial Intelligence or AI. AI is no longer optional. It is no longer a nice to have skill. Whether you work in project management, quality, operations, business analysis, leadership,

00:01:02

consulting or any field, AI is already changing how decisions are made, how work is done and how professionals are evaluated. The real risk today is not that AI will replace you. The real risk is that someone who knows how to use AI better than you will.

00:01:23

That is why staying updated is critical. And hence, I encourage you to subscribe to AI Pulse, AIGPE's free daily newsletter. This newsletter is pure knowledge, no cost, no hidden catch, no obligation.

00:01:41

If you want to understand what AI developments actually mean for professionals like you, this is where you start. Scan the QR code on the screen and complete the free subscription. Now, we will look at point two and here is where it gets even more valuable. When you subscribe to the AI Pulse newsletter, you unlock access to a completely free, accredited

00:02:07

foundational AI course called AI Prompting Mastery Certification. Let me be very clear about this. This course is not a demo. It is not a teaser.

00:02:20

It is not a watered down introduction. AI Prompting Mastery is a full certification course. Its actual market price is $699. It is accredited and it provides PMI PDUs, CPDs, PDCs and CEUs. And you can unlock it at zero cost, no extra fees, no hidden conditions.

00:04:24

It will become part of your long term professional growth. Once again, welcome to the AIGPE family. Let's get started.

00:00:00

Welcome to this important conversation. By the end of this program, you will gain knowledge. You will build skills. You will understand tools. But let's pause for a second. Is knowledge alone enough anymore? Thousands of professionals today have skills. Many can explain concepts. Some can even apply them. Yet when it comes to careers, promotions, credibility and trust, not all skills are

00:00:25

treated equally. The real question is this. How do you prove what you know? That's where certification enters the picture. Certification tells the market one clear thing. Your capability has been assessed, verified and recognized.

00:00:42

And this is exactly what AIGPE certifications are designed to do. AIGPE certifications are not participation-based. They are not completion certificates. They are earned. AIGPE certification is backed by a structured exam process that evaluates how well you

00:01:01

understand concepts, how you think and how you apply knowledge in real-world situations. But credibility doesn't stop at the exam. AIGPE certifications are accredited by the globally respected CPD Standards Office, UK, ensuring your learning meets international professional development benchmarks.

00:01:25

AIGPE is also an authorized training partner of the Project Management Institute, popularly known as PMI, a globally trusted name in professional certification. In addition, AIGPE is recognized as a provider of choice by the Society for Human Resource

00:01:42

Management, also known as SHRM, reinforcing its relevance across leadership, operations and people-focused roles. Once you successfully pass the certification exam, your credential carries these recognitions proudly, as powerful markers of professional trust, as signals that hiring managers immediately

00:02:03

recognize, as evidence that your capability has been independently validated. Now that you have the full picture, let's walk through what we will cover in this lecture. We are going to address the questions that matter most when you are considering a professional certification.

00:02:20

What are the official certification requirements? Who is eligible to take the certification exam? What rules and guidelines should you know before attempting the exam? What is the certification exam fee? What proven strategies can help you prepare effectively? And finally, once you pass the exam, what happens next? Let's begin.

00:02:41

So question one, what are the certification requirements? To earn any professional certification issued by Advanced Innovation Group Pro Excellence, the requirements are clear and consistent. First, you must complete the associated training program in full. This means watching every lecture, completing all required activities, and ensuring your

00:03:04

course progress reaches 100% completion. Second, you must take and pass the certification exam with a minimum score of 60%. This passing benchmark applies uniformly across all AIGP certification exams and is designed

00:03:21

to confirm a genuine understanding and practical application of the subject matter. Third, there are no additional prerequisites, prior experience requirements, or hidden conditions. This standardized structure ensures that every AIGP certification remains accessible, fair,

00:03:41

and professionally credible while maintaining consistency across programs. Who is eligible to take the certification exam? To be eligible to appear for any AIGP certification exam, you must be a verified paid subscriber to the platform offering this certification program.

00:04:01

Certification eligibility is tied directly to active individual access. It's equally important to clarify who does not qualify. If your subscription has expired or lapsed, you are not eligible to request or appear for the certification exam. If multiple users are sharing a single subscription account, only the registered subscriber is

00:04:23

eligible. One account can be used to earn one certification per subscriber. If you are accessing the content through a free trial or promotional access, you are not eligible for certification. At AIGP, every certification exam goes through a strict verification process.

00:04:42

This process confirms subscriber authenticity, access validity, and individual eligibility before an exam attempt is approved. This level of diligence is intentional. It ensures that AIGP certifications are earned only by genuine learners, protects the integrity

00:05:01

of the credential, and preserves the global credibility and recognition of every certification issued. So, what are the certification testing guidelines? All AIGP certification exams are conducted entirely online, giving you the flexibility to take the exam at a time and place that works best for you.

00:05:22

Here's what you need to know about the exam format. The certification exam consists of 30 multiple-choice questions. It is an open-book exam, which means you may refer to the course materials while answering the questions. There is no time limit, allowing you to complete the exam at your own pace without unnecessary

00:05:43

pressure. You will receive access to the certification exam link through one of the final lectures of the course. You can take the exam from anywhere, at any time, as long as you have a stable, high-speed internet connection, a quiet, focused environment that allows you to complete the exam without

00:06:01

interruptions. This exam structure is intentionally designed to be fair, flexible, and learner-centric while still ensuring that your understanding and application of concepts are properly evaluated. What is the certification exam cost?

00:06:20

At AIGP, we believe certification should measure capability, not create barriers. That's why the first two attempts at any AIGP certification exam are provided at no additional cost. This gives you the confidence to attempt the exam seriously, learn from the experience if needed, and succeed without financial pressure.

00:06:42

Need an additional attempt? No problem. Any attempt beyond the first two comes with a modest fee of $19.99 per attempt. This structure is intentional. It gives you the freedom to learn, prepare, and approach the exam with confidence, knowing

00:07:00

you have more than one opportunity to succeed without turning certification into a financial burden. So, how can you prepare well for the certification exam? While the certification exam is open-book and untimed, don't mistake that for simplicity. This is not a memory test. You will encounter real-world scenario-based questions designed to evaluate not just what

00:07:25

you know, but how well you can apply concepts in practical situations. So, how do you prepare effectively? Here are a few essential strategies. Study in-depth. Don't skim the content. Go deep into each concept covered in the video lectures.

00:07:43

Focus on understanding the why behind every principle, not just the definitions. Practice extensively. Use the section and quizzes to reinforce your learning. Repeat them until you are confident in your reasoning. Beyond that, apply the concepts and tools in your real-world environment whenever possible.

00:08:04

Practical exposure strengthens understanding far more than passive study. Remember this. Thorough preparation plus practical application is equal to exam success. Your journey toward earning an AIGP Professional Certification begins with how seriously you

00:08:22

prepare today. Now, when you complete this course and successfully pass the certification exam, you won't just walk away with knowledge. You will earn a globally recognized professional credential. You will be awarded an official and accredited certification issued by Advanced Innovation

00:08:41

Group Pro Excellence. Once you successfully complete the certification exam, you will receive a comprehensive digital certification kit that formally recognizes your achievement and professional standing.

stakeholders worldwide.

Hi and welcome to this lecture. Before we dive into timelines and milestones, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Project scheduling. Project scheduling is one of the most critical parts of project management. It's about more than just setting dates. It's about creating a living structure that keeps your project on track.

00:00:21

A good schedule connects timelines, the full flow of work with durations and sequencing, milestones, the checkpoints that prove real progress is being made, dependencies, the logic that ensures tasks happen in the right order, visualization, schedules that teams and stakeholders

00:00:40

can easily understand, documentation, embedding timelines and milestones into charters, plans and reports. But here's the important part. At the heart of project scheduling are timelines and milestones. Think of scheduling like a building. The timeline is the framework, the beams and walls that give it structure.

00:01:05

The milestone are the floors, the checkpoints that show how far you have come. Without these two pillars, the rest of scheduling, dependencies, visualization, adjustments has nothing to stand on. That's why in this section, we will start with timelines and milestones.

00:01:23

You will see how they form the foundation of scheduling, how they differ from each other and why they matter in every project. From there, we will build upward into the full discipline of AI-powered project scheduling, where ChatGPT helps you design timelines, manage milestones, handle dependencies and

00:01:43

adapt your schedule in real time. So as you go through these lectures, remember, timelines give direction, milestones prove progress. Together, they form the foundation of every project schedule.
