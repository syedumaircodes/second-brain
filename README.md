# Second Brain - Notes Backup

I’m a software engineer who learns by writing things down. This workspace exists as a public reflection of that habit. The notes here come from my work, my studies, and my ongoing attempt to understand systems, tools, and ideas more clearly. I write primarily for myself, but I publish these notes openly in case they’re useful to others walking a similar path.
